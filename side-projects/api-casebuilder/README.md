I am a software tester, so I mainly focused on how to test software and how to improve the software
tester productivity in testing. Some common issues we faced is that :

- need to implement automation testing but tester is not good at programing 
- lack of time in learning programing and implement automate testing 

So I want to build a tools that can connect the test case design and write automation test cases to solve
the issues that tester confronted.

This tool is right now focused on API testing.

## What is API case builder

API case builder is try to call api through API contract. It is a postman like tool.
What's beyond the postman is that I want to make is as a tools connect the API contract definition
and api test case design ,test code generation, CI. 

Overall, I want to build a tool just like a pipeline of how to delivery the workable API 
in a productivity way.


Some reference tools actually there are :
- RAML
- SWAGGER
- .......


it is just a raw writing and a POC project.
